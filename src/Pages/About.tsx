        Hello! My name is Muhammad Yousaf, and I am a MERN stack developer
        currently in my first semester of a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer
        Science. My journey in technology began with a passion for crafting
        engaging digital experiences. After completing my intermediate
        education, I focused on MERN stack development, mastering MongoDB,
        Express.js, React, and Node.js. I have also gained proficiency in HTML,
        CSS, and Bootstrap for creating responsive and visually appealing web
        interfaces. JavaScript is my primary language for both frontend and
        backend development, and I use Redux Toolkit for efficient state
        management in React applications. Currently, I am expanding my skill set
        by enrolling in a mobile development course that covers React Native,
        further broadening my ability to create comprehensive and versatile
        solutions.
